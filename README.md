# Selection Sort in C

This is a simple C program that demonstrates the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Introduction

This program performs selection sort on an array of integers, arranging them in ascending order. It uses a straightforward algorithm to find the smallest element in each pass and swaps it with the element in the current position. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Compile the Program**: Use a C compiler to compile the `main.c` file.

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program, which will sort the array and display the sorted result.

## Program Explanation

The program initializes an array of integers, performs selection sort on the array, and then prints the sorted array.

- `int array[]`: The array to be sorted is defined here with sample integer values.

- `int size`: The number of elements in the array.

- The program uses nested loops to find the minimum element and swap it with the current element in the outer loop. This process continues until the array is sorted.

## Sample Output

Upon running the program, you will see the sorted array printed to the console.
